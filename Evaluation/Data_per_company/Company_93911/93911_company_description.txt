Our Story:  
After completing her master's in Budapest and Taiwan, one of our co-founders moved directly to Berlin to immerse herself in social media, building her expertise and an impressive network.

The other co-founder began her career post-masterâ€™s in St. Gallen, Switzerland, at a Munich-based SaaS company, where she led the company's complete rebranding as the team lead for brand management.

Both were always clear about wanting to become entrepreneurs. In 2018, they decided to start their own digital agency. From the beginning, they focused on social media, establishing themselves as leading experts in the field.

Our hearts beat for the community and our clients, not for cumbersome structures. A collaboration with 99needs also means working on an equal footing, with direct and clear communication. Our clients are not just names on a list; they are our partners.
