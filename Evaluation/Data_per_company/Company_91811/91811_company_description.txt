About Us: Company Profile

Our company name is synonymous with top-level medical technology today. The beginnings of our founder were modest, starting in a basement in Bavaria in 1982 with the creation of the first defibrillator, laying the foundation for our medical device company.

Our goal has always been to develop and produce extremely robust and well-designed devices for preclinical and clinical cardiotherapy. Despite the pressures of globalization and increasing costs, we remain committed to highly qualified engineers and quality that is "Made in Germany," with our locations based in two key cities.

Join us in supporting lifesavers! We are seeking motivated individuals ready to embrace challenges and maximize their potential.

Our shared objective is to develop, produce, and sell high-quality, reliable products for lifesaving operations across emergency services, air rescues, patient transport, clinics, military, and disaster response.

As an innovative family business, we offer a dynamic and modern environment, emphasizing long-term prospects and secure employment.
