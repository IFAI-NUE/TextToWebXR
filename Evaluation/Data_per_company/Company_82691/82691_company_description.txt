About Us: Established in 2002 as a sole proprietorship, our real estate agency has evolved and is now a proud company specializing in commercial properties. We strive for more than just transactions; our goal is to help our clients achieve their objectives and gain real value. Regionally, we hold a leading market position. We believe in the importance of delivering the highest quality of service, honest advice, professionalism, and deep market understanding.

Our core area is in and around Kempten and the Swabia region, but we also handle retail and investment properties across Germany. Our services include asset management and project development.
