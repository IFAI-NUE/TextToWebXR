About Us: Stirred or Dried?

The answer is both at Bolz Process Technology Ltd. in Wangen, where machines and system solutions for mixing and drying processes are produced under the Bolz-Summix brand. This process technology is mainly used in the pharmaceutical industry, but also in chemical applications, fine chemicals, and the food sector. A team of 36 manages the entire value chain, from machine development to assembly and customer service. Whether a small lab unit or a 30,000-liter capacity system is needed, production always starts from batch size one. In 2023, Bolz Process Technology Ltd. generated approximately 12 million euros in revenue globally.

Coffee and cocoa, baby formula milk powder, dietary supplements, or a medication for potency—products like these are gently dried or mixed during their production, sometimes both. These procedures are the core of the company in Wangen, which has been part of Heinkel Drying and Separation Group since 2010. The group plans, constructs, manufactures, delivers, and installs centrifuges, vacuum and filter dryers, mixers, and system components and ensures lifelong after-sales service.

"We provide health, enjoyment, and fun," states the Managing Director.

Gentle Drying

Various dryers developed at Bolz Process Technology Ltd. handle thermal solid-liquid separation. Complete systems, including controls that manage the entire process from filling to drying, cooling, unloading, and cleaning, are designed and manufactured per customer requests. An example is the conical screw dryer, a vacuum contact dryer with a closed design and indirect heating via the container walls. This gentle drying preserves the crystalline structures of the material, essential for pharmaceutical applications.

Thorough Mixing

In the conical screw mixer, a rotating mixing screw, guided by an orbital arm, maintains a constant distance along the container wall. This allows gentle processing of various preparations in the food industry. Mixing and drying can be combined or modified to enable special processes. Coffee beans and cocoa, for instance, are treated in the conical screw cooker with heat and steam to release bitter substances before roasting, enhancing the final product's taste. An in-house testing center in Wangen is available for testing procedures. If needed, the system can be loaned to customers with a process engineer to conduct trials on-site and find suitable solutions.

Worldwide Presence

Bolz-Summix products are found globally: "We utilize premium materials such as stainless steel or titanium, and our machines last at least 30 years. Our business is roughly 60% new installations and 40% services," explains the Managing Director, who has been leading the company for six years. Under his leadership, the company has been restructured for greater efficiency, growing from 21 employees to 36, with plans to reach 41 by 2024. The growth strategy seeks service technicians and process engineers, as well as new talents in sales and administration. "We offer our team more than the classic fruit basket—even though we still provide that," the Managing Director says. Benefits include permanent contracts, flexible work hours, financial security with retirement plans, opportunities for participation, and budgets for personalized development.

The company sees a bright future, especially with strides in digitalization: At the end of September, Bolz Process Technology Ltd. showcased Bolz-Summix solutions at the Powtech trade fair in Nuremberg with a virtual showroom—a project accomplished with the Digital Future Center in Leutkirch and its Virtual Reality resources.
