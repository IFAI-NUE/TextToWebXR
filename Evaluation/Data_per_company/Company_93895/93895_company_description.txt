About Us: Paper Management Solutions

We specialize in flexible paper management solutions for automated processing of digital printing products. From cutting, folding, inserting, to verifying documents and attaching plastic cards, our systems offer advanced technology and high reliability for diverse needs, from transaction printing to graphic arts applications.

Our unique principle is to meet individual customer requirements by configuring a paper management system from over 100 combinable modules. These modules can be integrated with each other and into existing systems. For new customer applications, modules can be quickly and easily reconfigured. Our modular concept automates applications that were often manual before.

From mechanics to electronics to software, we develop and produce almost all components at the highest quality level. This not only accelerates system development and ensures long-term availability of spare parts but also allows for customer-specific adjustments at any time.

Flexible. Intelligent. Efficient.
