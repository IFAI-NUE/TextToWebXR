About Us: Great daycare, great support, great management: This is the success triad of Catholic daycare centers in the Diocese of Augsburg. The St. Simpert Daycare Center is an important partner in this. It actively supports and relieves the Catholic daycare centersâ€”from accounting to facility management. This allows the professionals in the centers to focus solely on their educational mission, while parish communities and church foundations have more time for pastoral care. All daycare centers in the Diocese benefit from our expertise.
