About Us: What do the Kramer Tunnel near Garmisch, the House of Bavarian History in Regensburg, the Bavaria Cycling Initiative, and the University of the Armed Forces in Neubiberg have in common? They are projects of the Bavarian State Ministry for Housing, Construction, and Transport. The Bavarian State Construction Administration, with its 22 State Building Authorities, the State Building Directorate, and the planning and construction divisions at the seven regional governments, handles the construction tasks of the Free State with great expertise and foresight.

The present and future bring significant challenges in housing, construction, and transportation. We embrace these challenges and address them with well-thought-out measures, long-term planning, top-notch services â€” and knowledgeable, motivated colleagues.

The Bavarian State Construction Administration is responsible for all areas of construction and transportation, as well as the promotion of housing and urban development in Bavaria. It also includes the state construction, real estate, and housing development companies, as well as the property management of the Free State. We advance not only buildings and roads but also people. We offer jobs in exciting professions and have a wide range of training and study opportunities.
