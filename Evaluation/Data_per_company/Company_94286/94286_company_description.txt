About Us: Our group comprises various companies, each offering tailored solutions to meet diverse business needs. Our approach is built on fair competition for ideas and markets, representing not just interests but convictions. We hold a high standard for our company culture, valuing teamwork, personal growth, responsibility, and support. Key values include humanity, collegiality, appreciation, and trust, embraced across all levels.

Despite our size and dynamic growth, we maintain a family-like atmosphere with flat hierarchies, swift decision-making, and transparent feedback. Teamwork and the two-person verification principle are essential to our operations. Cross-location collaboration on projects is vital, alongside the cohesion between experts and administrative roles.

Careers: 
- Corporate Finance: Opportunities exist from economic consulting and due diligence to tax structuring and business valuation. We also provide solutions for restructuring, process, and risk management in collaboration with various legal experts. Employees are integrated into client work early, receiving extensive support through our academy and external training, encouraging qualifications like the Certified Valuation Analyst (CVA) and Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA).

- Auditing and Tax Consulting: Experience with municipal companies is valued but not required. Our consulting seamlessly weaves together business, law, and technology. New team members starting as Junior Consultants or Tax Clerks receive support for professional development into roles like Accountant or Senior Consultant. Through our academy, we sponsor further education, such as the CPA or CFA certifications.

- Management and Strategy Consulting: Our consulting extends beyond legal issues to IT strategy, energy technology, production strategies, process changes, sales, and marketing. New colleagues engage in projects from the start, guided by experienced staff. We support professional growth through selected external and internal training opportunities.

Education, Study, and Internships: We prioritize nurturing talent, welcoming young individuals to explore careers and secure long-term roles. For recent graduates interested in merging theory and practice within a specialized field, we offer dual degree programs:
- Dual degree in Business Administration in collaboration with Munich University.

We emphasize personal mentorship during training to ease the transition into careers. Students from diverse disciplines can gain practical experience with us. Opportunities to write relevant theses are available, with the potential for post-graduation employment. Internship possibilities are also offered.
