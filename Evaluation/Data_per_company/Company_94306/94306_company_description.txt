About Us: We unite around 190,000 member businesses and connect them across various networks, making us strong as the National Federation of Machinery Rings. We are helpers, service providers, advisors, lenders, and often rescuers in tough times. Above all, we are the largest cooperative for agricultural self-help since 1958. WE ARE THE COMMUNITY OF MACHINERY RINGS: We exist 240 times in Germany across twelve regional associations, covering 14 states.

What began with a dozen farmers in a small Bavarian village now resonates in the minds of hundreds of thousands worldwide. The idea of organizing in machinery ring communities has spread across much of Europe and since 2018, even to Africa. In Germany, machinery rings remain the backbone of agricultural farming. Our community concept has continually grown since the first founding thoughts. Today, the machinery rings cover a wide range of services for their member businesses:

- We supply over 46,000 businesses and households with electricity.
- We provide thousands of farmers with additional financial income.
- Our community has access to a wide range of exclusive purchasing benefits.
- We create proprietary digital applications for our member businesses.
- Our farm, village, and household helpers provide hundreds of thousands of hours of indispensable assistance.
- Nationwide, over 3,000 employees ensure we remain the best service provider in agriculture.

WE SPREAD OUR IDEAS WORLDWIDE

Do you know what makes us really proud? Our founding idea is passed on from generation to generation and even across borders. In 2018, we took the biggest geographical step: with courage, heart, and a great vision, we went to Africa. We believe in our idea, although we had some fears. What if our development cooperation only sounds good on paper? What if the impact on local farmers is only short-lived? Our fears have faded. There are now over 100 machinery rings in Senegal and Kenya. Thousands of small farmers have access to agricultural technology, knowledge, and organizational structures. Our goal: No farmer should suffer from hunger. They should be able to provide food for themselves, their families, and their communities.

What sets us apart?

- COMMUNITY-ORIENTED: Our farmers share the same interests and face the same challenges. Together, we can achieve more.
- EFFICIENT: Collaborative working means being efficient. Everything we do, from machine sharing to training, is geared towards that.
- FUTURE-ORIENTED: We focus on preserving what matters to us while keeping an eye on the future. We embrace the new and utilize it.

We invite you to be part of our strong community and support the most important profession in the world to usâ€”the farmer!
