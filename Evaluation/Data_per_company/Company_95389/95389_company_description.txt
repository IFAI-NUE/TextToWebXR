Currently, we employ about 40 people at our site. We are leaders in the selenium sector.

Our slogan is: Focused on Selenium.

Technical and Development Focus

Laminar Oxidation
We have developed the direct laminar oxidation of selenium using pure oxygen, a unique technique worldwide. This positions us as manufacturers with the highest environmental standards and the best product quality. Several modern computer-controlled oxidation systems produce either selenium dioxide or selenious acid.

Ultra-Pure Selenium Production
In the ultra-pure selenium sector, we boast state-of-the-art equipment for purification, reduction, and alloying. Modern cleanroom technology and a vacuum drying cabinet ensure the highest standards in drying and packaging. The reduction reactor is the heart of ultra-pure selenium production, processing highly purified selenious acid into reduction powder selenium.

Selenium Oxidation Plant
Our proprietary selenium oxidation plant has made us a global leader in ultra-pure selenium and selenium chemicals. The plants are continuously developed and improved, equipped with modern software and control electronics, and are computer-controlled and monitored.

Spray Drying
Since introducing spray drying for sodium selenite in 1997, we have significantly improved both product quality and working conditions. Compared to traditional ground products, ours are low-dust and free of larger particles, allowing for better mixture homogeneity in feed and increased employee safety in feed production.

Quality Control in Our Own Laboratory
Products undergo constant checks in our in-house laboratory to ensure they meet the purity criteria of respective industries. Few producers worldwide can manufacture ultra-pure selenium with a purity level of 99.999%.

Environment and Sustainability
We hold numerous certifications that attest to our careful handling of resources, suppliers, employees, and the environment. Our raw materials are sourced only from countries adhering to all environmental standards. Regular inspections ensure oversight of the entire supply and production chain, focusing on environmental regulations, workplace safety, and human rights compliance.
