About Us: 

Our organization was established in 1969 by employer associations in Bavaria and operates with a commitment to societal and political objectives. Today, it is one of the largest educational entities in Germany. Under our umbrella, there are 14 educational, integration, and consulting organizations with approximately 10,500 employees, primarily in Bavaria, as well as nationwide and internationally in 25 countries across four continents.

We assist individuals in acquiring job-related skills, retraining, and continuing education. We also help balance family and work life through our social services, such as childcare and school programs, or elder care, enabling family members to focus on their careers.

We support companies in preparing their workforce for the ever-changing work environment. Our goal is to maintain economic competitiveness and capitalize on the opportunities presented by digital transformation.

Every day, we train around 50,000 individuals at 500 locations across Germany, with more than 26,000 children benefiting from our care services.
