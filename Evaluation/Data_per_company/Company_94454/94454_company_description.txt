About Us: As a founding team, we are convinced of the idea of making aging properties more energy-efficient, functional, and overall attractive. The main goal of our company is to address the shortage of living space by creating additional housing in our operational area. This is achieved through both the development of attic spaces and new construction projects.

As a real estate developer from Bavaria, we build properties in Middle Franconia and the Upper Palatinate. For every construction project we undertake, we always ask ourselves three questions:
1. Is this project appealing for both personal use and as an investment?
2. What advantages can we offer our customers with this project?
3. What are the costs compared to the long-term savings?

Whether as an investment or for personal use, a property increases wealth. Planning your assets early and strategically is not only sensible but essential. A property is not just an investment but a savings plan for your personal future. We have been successful with our own properties for years and wish to offer this opportunity to our customers as well.
