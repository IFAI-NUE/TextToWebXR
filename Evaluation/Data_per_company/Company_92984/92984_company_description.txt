About Us: We are a young company based in Friedrichshafen and Gmund am Tegernsee. From here, we help businesses digitalize their processes, products, and organizations using Jira, Confluence, and Salesforce, enabling them to better utilize their potential. We operate across various industries and business areas, such as customer service, project management, facility management, HR, or sales. Our partners include start-ups, medium-sized companies, and hidden champions.

We aren't just IT specialists; we emphasize communication and understanding people. We avoid unnecessary hierarchies and work in small, self-organized teams.
