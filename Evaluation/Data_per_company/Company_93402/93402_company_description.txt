About Us: We embody the color orange. Not you? That's great! We offer our employees the freedom to express themselves and discover their own "orange." For us, orange is more than just a company color; it's our mindset. It defines how we interact, work, and who we are.

As a family-run business in its third generation, based in the Franken region, we are also a global leader in surface processing with 15 locations worldwide. Whether in mass finishing, shot blasting, or manufacturing process media, for over 80 years, we've been delivering high-quality solutions to companies around the globe. We also have a presence in the 3D printing sector with our brand, AM Solutions.

See for yourself and become a part of our team. Show us your "orange" and letâ€™s influence each other!
