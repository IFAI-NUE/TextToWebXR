A secure professional future is no coincidence at REWE. The reasons: Conscious and healthy eating is becoming increasingly important in many people's lives, making expertise in this area highly sought after. The food retail industry is one of the most crisis-resistant sectors. At REWE, you can be extra sure: As one of the largest training companies in German retail, REWE invests greatly in the development and education of all employees. For instance, over a quarter of our store managers are under 30 years old. This is no accident, but the result of targeted career planning, the foundation of which is laid during training with us.
