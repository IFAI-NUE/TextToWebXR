About Us: The forward-thinking development of urban districts and large real estate projects paves the way for the economic success of cities and metropolitan areas. Valuable land is gained by converting previously industrial or military sites and inner-city wastelands, as well as by revitalizing existing buildings, especially in central, desirable locations. As experienced specialists in conversion and revitalization, we support investors, builders, and developers in successfully executing large projects.

Our team provides sustainable assessments for realistic cost calculations and reliable risk evaluations to support decision-making. During implementation, we assist our clients with zoning approvals and offer comprehensive project management, including construction management and cost monitoring. Our clients benefit from interdisciplinary expertise and proven process knowledge from numerous large projects. We have extensive experience in site clearance, ordinance removal, infrastructure development, and the integration of renewable energy. We handle all aspects of project management, including financial controlling.
