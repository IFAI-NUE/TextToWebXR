About Us: Our company specializes in the development and implementation of electrochemical syntheses, combining electrical energy with chemical synthesis to produce both organic and inorganic products. As the chemical industry moves towards electrification, we are the first start-up in Germany to focus on electrosynthesis as a core technology. Founded in 2018, we aim to scale electrochemical screening into high-throughput screening, integrating statistical methods and AI to significantly accelerate chemical process development.

In addition to direct industry collaborations, we value our own innovations and their licensing. This is achieved through independent projects and publicly funded research and development initiatives, both nationally and across Europe. Our projects include zinc and copper recycling from combustion residues, producing paraffins and white oils from bio-based waste, and recycling persistent organic chemical waste, all with development at the forefront.
