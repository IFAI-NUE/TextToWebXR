**Interaction Flow**

Visitors start at a central info kiosk and choose a thematic station (e.g., Electrification or Lighting). Engage with interactive 3D models and video pods, followed by hands-on areas with prototypes and testing stations. Concludes with feedback terminals and contact points for inquiries or project discussions.

**Zones Layout**

The space is organized into freestanding zones: a central orientation point, multiple themed stations for core pillars, a hands-on lab area, a demo stage for larger modules, and relaxation/conversation zones. Space distribution: central orientation and prominently placed demonstrators, peripheral detail stations, and a small meeting area. All zones are designed as standalone freestanding units.

**Key Objects**

Important freestanding items include: 
1. Full-scale module demonstrators (Function: Demonstration, typically heavy, reduced mobility/on rollers possible).
2. Prototype benches and testing stations (Function: Hands-on testing, usually mobile/movable).
3. Interactive kiosks/media pods (Function: Information dissemination, mostly portable).
4. Charging/energy mockups and lighting rigs (Function: System function demos, freestanding and partially mobile). Each object functions independently and can be relocated if needed.
