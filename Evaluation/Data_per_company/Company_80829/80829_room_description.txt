interaction_flow
Visitors start at a standalone intro station with a short film and menu selection (guided or free mode). In guided mode, modular showcases for each sector follow, featuring interactive models, technical detail stations, and project catalogs. The free path allows for deeper exploration of individual systems, digital twins, and expert contact. Concluding with meeting pods for in-depth discussions and digital materials for download.

zones_layout
Zones are organized as standalone islands: reception and intro hub, sector shows (semiconductors, batteries, biotech/pharma, data centers), technical deep-dive labs with models and digital twins, case study gallery with project models, and meeting and consulting islands. Space allocation is modular: larger show islands for core sectors, smaller niches for detailed technical displays, and an area for personnel and benefits information. All elements are independently positionable, allowing clear access paths between the islands.

anchor_objects
Freestanding anchor objects include: large-format cleanroom model modules as demonstration objects (functional for displaying airflow and interfaces), scale model factories and equipment rack replicas for detailed views, interactive holography or projection tables for digital twins, touch kiosks for case study selection, and modular meeting pods for advisory sessions. Mobility: Models and kiosks are mostly mobile or on wheels; meeting pods are designed as portable modules.

circulation_accessibility
No specific indications of minimum aisle widths, entry points, or detailed accessibility requirements in the context. Generally, a high standard of reliability and quality is emphasized, but specific accessibility guidelines are not mentioned.

ambience
The exhibition atmosphere is inspired by controlled, technical precision suitable for cleanroom and high-tech projects: clear, neutral lighting and a subtle, objective soundscape to support explanatory content. No scent indications are provided. Audio content focuses on technical explanations, project videos, and guided tours.
