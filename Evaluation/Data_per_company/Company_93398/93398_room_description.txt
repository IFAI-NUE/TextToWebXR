**Portfolio Focus**

Showcasing standalone system modules, operational demo units, modular prototypes, and sample product combinations. Accompanied by mobile spare parts and component displays, as well as interactive information stations with product videos and documentation. Handling: Visitors observe functional demonstrations and engage in guided interactions; Safety instructions and access rules for operating machines are provided.

**Narrative Assets**

Headline: Modular. Precise. Available Worldwide. Core messages: 1) Over 100 combinable modules allow for customized configurations; 2) Mostly in-house development and production ensure spare parts availability and customizability; 3) Solutions automate previously manual processes for high reliability. Measurable metrics & external signals: Over 100 modules, company size 50–249 employees, global client base; Job postings indicate a need for electronic and software expertise.

**Interaction Flow**

Visitors select between a guided demo or a self-guided tour at an information desk. The sequence includes modular demonstration stations, a live demo stage, hands-on test areas, and a consultation meeting island. The process emphasizes short interactions, explanatory media content, and optional technical discussions.

**Zones Layout**

The presentation is organized into a series of standalone islands: large-scale demonstration islands for operational systems, compact hands-on islands for interaction and testing, a service and spare part showcase, and several small consulting and meeting islands. Space allocation prioritizes demo islands, followed by hands-on and service displays, with separate communication islands for discussions.

**Anchor Objects**

Standalone demonstration systems (configurable machine modules) serve as main anchors, mostly mobile or semi-mobile. Mobile display towers show product configurations and case studies; interactive touch kiosks and tablet stations provide information and software demos. Prototype benches and mobile spare part shelves serve as hands-on and service anchors; meeting islands are planned as standalone furniture.

**Circulation Accessibility**

Specific guidelines for minimum aisle widths, entrances, or accessible dimensions: Not specified. General requirement from context: Accessible entrances and safe passage areas are considered in machine presentations, with no detailed measurements or regulations provided.

**Ambience**

Specific guidelines for lighting, audio, music, or scent are not described in the current context, therefore: No specification.
