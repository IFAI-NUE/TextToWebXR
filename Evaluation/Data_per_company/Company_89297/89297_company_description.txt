About Us: Our company develops innovative properties across Europe. We view buildings as products and offer all services from a single source: from design and construction to operational services. 

With the commitment to "building excellence," we create properties that are economical, fast, and sustainable with customized functionality. Our success factors include comprehensive planning expertise, in-house industrial prefabrication, and leading technologies for systematic construction. Humanity, responsibility, and dedication form the values of our family business. Solution-oriented team members support our clients in local branches and act as local entrepreneurs. With experience from around 12,000 projects and driving digital innovation, we ensure our products function optimally, including future readiness.

We partner with mid-sized businesses, large companies, investors, developers, and public clients. Our offerings include logistics and industrial halls, office and school buildings, parking garages, and residential buildings. Renovations and building-related services complete our spectrum. In the 2022/2023 fiscal year, we completed 573 projects with a total output of 6.7 billion euros. Currently, we employ over 12,000 people at more than 100 locations across Europe.

Our Eastern regional division, based in Treuen, has around 500 employees across eight locations in Thuringia, Saxony, and Bavaria. The Southern division, located in Neuried near Munich, also has about 500 employees across Stuttgart, Munich, Ulm, Rosenheim, and the Lake Constance area.
