About Us: Empowering a Clean Future

Clean and affordable energy for everyone is one of the greatest challenges of our time. We have taken on this challenge and are building the energy system of the future. We develop new technologies and business models, such as intelligent energy storage for renewable solar power, digital services, and our virtual power plant for producers and consumers. This enables independence from fossil fuels and traditional energy providers.

With locations in Germany, Italy, the UK, the USA, and Australia, we employ dedicated team members driven by passion and a commitment to change.

Energy is yours!
