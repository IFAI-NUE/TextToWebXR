About Us: Comprehensive Solutions for Sewer Inspection and Leak Testing

We are a well-known developer and manufacturer of TV inspection systems and leak testing equipment, as well as application-oriented vehicle outfitting based in Lindau. Since our founding in 1980, we've developed and manufactured numerous products for optical pipe and sewer examination, leak testing, and wastewater line repair. Our many patents and registered designs safeguard our expertise and confirm our commitment to innovation and practicality.

We specialize in vehicle outfitting, working closely with future users to discuss and plan customer projects extensively.
