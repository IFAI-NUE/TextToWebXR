Pillar 2 (35%): Machinery & Equipment – Complete range for special foundation and resource exploration; Benefit: Market-leading technology for construction and mining companies; Evidence: Leading position in machinery for special foundation engineering. Pillar 3 (25%): Resources & Services – Drilling services, well construction, environmental tech, and remediation; Benefit: Integrated solutions for resource acquisition and environmental services; Evidence: Product and service offerings in the resources segment.

Culture Profile:
Values: Innovation, adaptability, sustainability, and employee engagement are central. Pace: Project-oriented with long-term stable growth, focusing on quality. Collaboration Style: Interdisciplinary and international, strong cooperation between technical, construction, and service units. Work Mode: Supports hybrid options (remote work possible), flexible hours, and on-site amenities like cafes and parking.

Portfolio Focus:
Features include free-standing models of drilling equipment and foundation construction methods, interactive 3D/VR construction site demos, video stations with project case films, and material samples. Handling: Interactive stations are user-friendly, with clearly defined non-operational machine models. Safety: Clear signage for large exhibits, restricted demonstration areas, and supervised VR stations.

Narrative Assets:
Headline: 230 Years of Innovation — Building Without Limits. Core Messages: 1) Leadership in special foundation machinery; 2) Comprehensive solutions from foundations to resource development; 3) Sustainability and adaptability as guiding principles. Measurable Indicators: Over 230 years of company history, approximately 12,000 employees, global locations from Houston to Singapore as external validation.

Interaction Flow:
Visitors choose between guided tours and self-service; start at the reception hub with an overview, then thematic zones (Construction, Machinery, Resources) with VR and hands-on stations, concluding with a Career Hub and networking area. General Path: Info reception → Segment zones with interactive demos → Innovations lab/projects → Career and contact zone. Interactive stations provide short tasks and guided simulations with curators and digital guides.

Zones Layout:
Free-standing reception and orientation island as the starting point, followed by thematic zones for special foundation, machinery, and resources. Includes a demo zone with large machine models, an innovations lab with VR stations, and a career/HR pod with seating areas. Space allocation: Focus on machinery and demo zones, medium space for project presentations, compact career and relaxation areas.

Anchor Objects:
Large models of drilling and special foundation equipment as focal points (stationary, heavy) for demonstration; scale models/mock-ups (non-operational) for hands-on explanations; VR stations and interactive kiosks (mobile or on wheels) for simulations; illuminated timeline pillars and core drill stacks as demonstrative material (easily repositionable). Function: Orientation, display of technical expertise, interaction, and knowledge dissemination.

Circulation Accessibility:
Minimum aisle width: not provided. Entrances/access to the free-standing islands: not provided. Accessibility: not provided.

Ambience:
Lighting: Targeted technical lighting for exhibits, warm accents at visitor stations, cool tones on machine models. Audio: Subtle, factual soundscape with construction noises, explanatory speech tracks, and specific presentation sequences. Music/Scent: Subdued industrial sound texture; scent concept: neutral, clean air with light earthy notes in resource exhibits for atmospheric enhancement.
