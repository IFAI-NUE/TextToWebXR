narrative_assets

Headline: Fair, User-Centric AI and Practical VR Solutions for Job Placement. Key Messages: We develop ethical guidelines and monitoring mechanisms to ensure fair AI in VR job boards; we establish usability standards and intuitive interactions for diverse user groups; we create prototype software solutions and supervise student research projects. Measurable Values & External Signals: No specific quantitative KPIs are given, but external signals include multiple project and job descriptions and the listed benefits.

interaction_flow

Methods: Self-guided exploration, guided demonstrations, and moderated user studies. General Pathway: Start at an info kiosk for topic selection, choose a demo station (VR or Web), conduct a hands-on session followed by reflection at a transparency and feedback station, conclude with additional information on projects and theses. Interactions focus on ease of use and explainable AI results.

zones_layout

Open Arrangement: Centrally grouped VR pods for hands-on sessions, flanked by interactive kiosks with web comparison demos and app prototypes. Complemented by plinths with e-paper displays and media pillars for video loops, as well as prototyping tables for workshops and student presentations. Separate conversation areas and mobile presentation spaces for moderation and user feedback complete the layout.

anchor_objects

VR Pods/Stations: Standalone headset stations with labels and hygiene protection, primarily for hands-on experiences; generally portable or modular. Interactive Kiosks/Terminals: Touchscreens for web comparison demos and app prototypes; serve information delivery and self-testing, mobile or easily placed. Demo Plinths with E-paper: Show prototypes and media content, serve as visual and functional anchors; usually transportable. Seating and Conversation Areas: For reflection and moderation, usually modular and movable. Mobile Whiteboards/Moderation Stands: For workshops and usability tests, easily movable.

circulation_accessibility

Flow & Access: Accessibility and usability for less experienced users are key focuses, with adapted interaction modes and explanatory elements. Specific minimum aisle widths, exact entry dimensions, or technical specifications are not provided.
