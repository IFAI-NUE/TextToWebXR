About Us: At Schneider Electric, our goal is to enable the optimal use of energy and resources for everyone, paving the way for progress and sustainability. We call this approach "Life Is On." 

Our mission is to be the digital partner for sustainability and efficiency. We drive digital transformation by integrating leading process and energy technologies worldwide, connecting products, controls, software, and services throughout their lifecycle, and providing integrated enterprise management for homes, buildings, data centers, infrastructure, and industry.

One of our key locations has approximately 750 employees and a revenue of around 180 million euros. This site has been operational since 1903, and in 1948, we established a base in Regensburg, which became part of Schneider Electric in 2010. The focus here is on designing customized switchgear and medium-voltage switchgear for both businesses and consumers. These systems are essential wherever large amounts of energy are needed for power supplyâ€”be it at airports, industrial facilities, or residential areas.

Many of our team members began their careers here, highlighting the strong connection and continuity of our team.

Schneider Electric offers diverse career opportunities, both locally and internationally. With a global workforce of 140,000 employees and locations in over 100 countries, there are ample chances to gain international and intercultural experiences and to grow professionally.
