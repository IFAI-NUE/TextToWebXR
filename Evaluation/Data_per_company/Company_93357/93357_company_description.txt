About Us: Our engineering firm is located in the heart of Munich, just 5 minutes from the University of Applied Sciences Munich, specializing in urban water management. We see ourselves as consultants for the planning phase and subsequent construction execution. Together, we develop optimal solutions for wastewater facilities, considering personal and environmental needs. Ensuring the operational safety of the facilities and preventing floods due to increasingly intense rainfall events are top priorities when developing our concepts. This results in structures designed for both people and the environment.
