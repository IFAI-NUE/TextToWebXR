### Interaction Flow
Visitors start at an orientation kiosk with a company overview, choosing between a guided tour or self-guided interactive kiosks. This is followed by sector-specific demo zones (Automotive, MedTech, Film, Industry) with live demos and supervised prototype benches, leading to an R&D corner for thesis projects and student positions; concluding with discussions at a consulting/contact station. Interactions combine video, hands-on activities, and moderated short presentations.

### Zone Layout
Freestanding orientation island with overview boards and kiosks, multiple demo islands grouped by theme (Automotive, MedTech, Film, Industry), a production/test island with prototype benches, an R&D and career area for theses and internships, and a media/screening island for film demos. Additional lounge islands for conversations and networking, plus a consulting/contact island. Area Allocation: Demo islands occupy the largest space, followed by test/production island and R&D corner, with smaller areas for lounges and orientation.

### Anchor Objects
Demonstration pedestals with active embedded systems and camera cores (freestanding, static), interactive touch kiosks for technical info and software demos (mobile/static), prototype benches and test stands from the test lab (freestanding, stationary, supervised), large freestanding video towers or screens for use case examples, presentation islands for theses and portfolio exhibits. Mobility: Kiosks and some demo boards are mobile, test stands generally stationary and supervised.
