About Us: Our journey began in 2015 with the introduction of our first ginger shot. Today, we offer a variety of flavors and sell premium ginger shots through a multi-channel distribution model: in stores, online, and in corporate sales. At our company, we combine traditional knowledge with modern ideas to naturally enhance customer well-being. In addition to ginger shots, we develop local smoothies and juice cleanses, aiming for continuous growth.

We are committed to sustainability and quality: all products are organic, vegan, and free from artificial additives. We prioritize sourcing raw materials from environmentally friendly, local farms, and our packaging is eco-friendly. We focus on conscious resource use and CO2-neutral logistics.

Our company culture emphasizes team spirit, flexibility, a flat hierarchy, and a dynamic work environment that encourages growth and enjoyment. Our employees experience flexibility with trusted work hours, the option to choose their work locations, and regular, appreciative exchanges. Health, respect, and open communication are fundamental for us.
