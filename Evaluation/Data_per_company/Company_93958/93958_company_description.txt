Our drive comes from a passion for quality, creativity, innovation, and a touch of craziness to create a "WOW" customer experience.

Our mission is to make retail more sustainable by eliminating the disposal of returned products. We aim to connect these products with the next satisfied customer in a way that benefits the buyer, the seller, and our planet. We envision a future where products have longer life cycles, brands can unlock new revenue streams, and consumers have easier access to their products.

New Returns focuses on leaner and more efficient operations, with an emphasis on AI automation and outsourcing whenever possible, as well as optimizing all internal and external processes. This approach aims to achieve the best results in e-commerce. Our team consists of about 40 young employees from various nationalities who actively speak English, Dutch, German, and French in the workplace. We highly value personal growth within the company, offering freedom and opportunities for creative expression and idea development. Mistakes are not only allowed but encouraged â€” our motto is: "80% and go."
