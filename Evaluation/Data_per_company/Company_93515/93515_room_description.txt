Interaction Flow

Modes: Self-guided tour via interactive kiosk, guided demonstrations, and career stations for engagement. 

Path: Start at a central information pillar, choose a topic line (Automotive, Rail, Smart Factory, Digital), visit thematic exhibit pods with interactive stations, conclude at a career/contact station. Each station offers short demos, in-depth media, and professional contact opportunities.

Zones Layout

Freestanding Arrangement: Central information pillar as a starting point, radially arranged thematic pods (Automotive Hub, Rail Hub, Smart Factory, Digital Lab).

Supplementary Clusters: Demo gallery with prototypes, video lounge, and career/networking zone.

Space Distribution: Dominant thematic pods for core offerings, smaller islands for career and relaxation, all accessible as standalone units.

Anchor Objects

Types/Examples: Vehicle prototype pod with display platform, cab mockup, machinery model, large interactive touch tables, standing holographic displays, demo racks for control electronics, and mobile info kiosks. 

Function: Demonstration, interaction, orientation, and information provision. 

Mobility: Many anchors are on rolling bases or as modular, movable units, allowing reconfiguration.

Circulation & Accessibility

Flow & Access: Recommended minimum aisle width between exhibits is 1.5 meters, clear, accessible entry to all pods.

Accessibility: Low information surfaces and tactile floor indicators at freestanding stations, audio descriptions, and high-contrast controls; seating available in island areas if needed.

Ambience

Lighting: Freestanding light pylons and directional spots with warm to neutral white LED lighting, accented with orange light elements. 

Audio/Music: Subtle, low-tempo electronic soundscape with localized speakers at exhibits for specific audio info.

Scent: Subtle, clean air with an optional light citrus note for brand association. All ambience elements integrated into freestanding lights, speaker towers, and scent dispensers.
