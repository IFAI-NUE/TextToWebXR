About Us: HL-Technik is an owner-managed planning office specializing in Technical Building Equipment, originally founded in 1968. In 2016, a new leadership team brought a forward-thinking vision to the company by integrating BIM and continually updating technological approaches. Based in Munich, our focus is on cutting-edge building technology. Our ambitious goal is to find compelling, sustainable solutions for the entire lifecycle of construction projects. We approach traditional technical construction tasks comprehensively and systemically, aiming to integrate technology, function, and design. Our challenge is to align individual desires with urban planning requirements, while sustainability objectives demand new resource-efficient concepts. In this challenging environment, we take on technical responsibility, as planning beyond the present suits both construction and our company ethos.
