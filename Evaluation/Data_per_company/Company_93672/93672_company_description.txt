About Us: Our organization is an independent provider of youth services, offering tailored support based on the Children and Youth Services Act for children, teenagers, and their families. We focus on the current life situations of our clients, tapping into their hidden creative potential to understand and address the underlying issues. This "process of understanding" is crucial, as we believe every behavior has deep meaning. By capturing this, we provide sustainable support. We aim to approach individuals openly and without prejudice, entering a collaborative process with them, true to our motto: creative support for creative families.
