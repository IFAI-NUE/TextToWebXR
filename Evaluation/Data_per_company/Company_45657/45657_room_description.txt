Narrative Assets
Headline: Precision Moves. Key Messages: 1) Over 120 years of experience in high-precision gear processing, 2) Custom system solutions tailored to customer needs, 3) Globally connected production and service for stable production processes. Measurable Metrics & Signals: Around 1,000 employees, machining tolerances to thousandths of a millimeter, workpiece diameters up to eight meters; external signals: global sales and service network.

Interaction Flow
Visitors start with a brief introduction at a central reception and info point, followed by themed areas for machines, tools, measurement, services, and digital solutions. Each area offers a mix of visual models, video and interactive stations, with optional guided demonstrations. Concluding with advisory and meeting pods for in-depth discussions; self-guided and guided modes are possible.

Zones Layout
The space is organized into freestanding areas: a central reception/orientation point, several demonstration zones (machines, tools, measurement), a digital interaction zone, and separate advisory or meeting pods. Supplemented by exhibit cubes for detailed exhibits and a lounge area for conversations and catering. Space distribution: Demonstration areas dominate the exhibit space, advisory and relaxation areas are smaller.

Anchor Objects
Typical anchor objects: full-scale machine exhibits as exhibition centerpieces, scaled machine and workpiece models, measurement frames, interactive info kiosks, and mobile tool presentations. Function: Demonstration, tactile/display, information delivery, and discussion anchors. Mobility: Heavy machines as fixed anchors, tool displays and info kiosks mostly mobile or movable.
