narrative_assets  
Headline: “Custom engineered TPE — material science meets sustainability.”  
Key Message 1: Market and customer-oriented development of TPE compounds.  
Key Message 2: Global expertise with locations in Europe, Asia, and North America.  
Key Message 3: Focus on sustainable raw materials and supply chain development.  
Metrics & Indicators: Over 700 employees, annual revenue exceeding €223 million, and explicit job requirements for sustainability development showcase expertise and growth.  

interaction_flow  
Visitors start at a standalone orientation pillar with a brief introduction and choose between product and sustainability paths. The product path leads to material samples and process demos; the sustainability path highlights raw material sources and supply chain cases. Final stations offer technical project examples and a career and contact hub for applications and exchanges.  

zones_layout  
Central orientation with clear axes leading to four standalone zones: Product Samples & Compounds, Process and Engineering Demos, Sustainability & Raw Material Stations, and Career & Collaboration Hub. Space allocation follows priority: Product samples and engineering dominate; sustainability and career are smaller yet accessible areas. All zones are designed as standalone, freely positioned units.  

anchor_objects  
Standalone sample podiums with material samples and tactile exploration; interactive touch kiosks for data insights and case studies; demonstration modules for material flow and process optimization (mobile); lab demonstrators for quality tests and raw material comparisons; independent career hubs for discussions and application information. Function: Inform, demonstrate, interact; Mobility: Mainly movable or rollable for setup and transport.
