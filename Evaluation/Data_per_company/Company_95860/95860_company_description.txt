About Us: We are cityUP!

For over two years, we've been developing a data-driven software solution that helps housing companies plan sustainable modernization strategies for their real estate portfolios.

Why?

The housing industry faces significant challenges: ambitious climate targets, rising construction and energy costs, limited subsidies, and a shortage of skilled workers—all based on fragmented data and outdated planning tools.

Our Solution: cityUP

Using official 3D building data, our software automatically creates digital twins for entire building portfolios. This provides a platform for housing companies to efficiently, flexibly, and transparently plan modernization strategies for their properties—at the neighborhood, building, and component levels, tailored to internal company goals.

Our Vision:

An intelligent, adaptable tool enabling complex investment decisions to be made intuitively, data-supported, and holistically—both economically and ecologically. A tool that organizes fragmented data and complex conditions for greater transparency, comparability, and accountability in strategic planning.

We are currently preparing for our pilot phase in collaboration with established housing companies. We welcome exchanges, new perspectives, and strong partners on our journey.
