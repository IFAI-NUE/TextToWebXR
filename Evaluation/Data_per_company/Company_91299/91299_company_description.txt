About Us: Our team is divided across various operations. The garden center, shops, guest and conference house, butchery, monastery tavern, and bakery are located in one area, while our organic farm with livestock and agriculture is situated in another. We practice an open and tolerant lifestyle. A respectful approach to people and the environment, as well as joy in our work, are particularly important to us. Additionally, "organic" and sustainability are not just labels for us; they are a way of life that our staff also embrace.
