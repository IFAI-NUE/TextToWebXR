narrative_assets

Headline: We electrify mobility – efficiently, safely, and globally. Core Messages: 1) EVO provides engineering services for the next generation of electric drives; 2) Focus on testing, validation, and cost-efficient turnkey solutions; 3) Use of data science, simulation, and AI to optimize energy management and system design. Measurable Metrics & External Indicators: Staff size 10–49, international reach, job openings in R&D, Data Science, and Testing/Validation as signs of competence.

interaction_flow

Visitors start at an info point with a brief introduction and choose between a guided tour or self-exploration. They proceed through sequential demo stations (concepts → prototypes → simulations) with interactive displays and optional live explanations from staff. The experience deepens in a “laboratory” area with technical demos and discussion opportunities, ending at a contact and networking station for follow-ups. Different modes (self-guided, guided, workshop-based) are available.

zones_layout

Entry and information area as a standalone reception unit, followed by a series of standalone demo stations for prototypes and test setups. Separate immersion or simulation zone for interactive visualizations and a prototype workspace for live demonstrations and workshops. Complementary lounge-style seating areas and meeting points for discussions and networking; specific space allocation not detailed.

anchor_objects

Standalone demo pedestals with touch interfaces for software and simulation results, vehicle models or drive units as exhibits, mobile testing stands/setups, prototype benches for hands-on demonstrations, and guidance pillars for orientation. Function: Presentation, interaction, explanation, and meeting point. Mobility: Some elements mobile/rollable (e.g., testing stands, prototype benches), others stationary; specific details not provided.
