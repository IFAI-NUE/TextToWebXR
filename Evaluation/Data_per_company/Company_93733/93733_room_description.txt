interaction_flow
Visitors start at a standalone orientation island with a concept explanation, choose between a guided tour and self-service mode at information kiosks. Followed by stationary viewing of models and cutaways, interactive simulation stations, and project case studies on monitor islands; conclude in a contact and consultation niche with a contact terminal. The process is modular, allowing visitors to target specific stations.

zones_layout
Entry area with standalone welcome island and information kiosk, followed by a model and demonstration zone with multiple display islands (models, cutaways, installation mockups). Workshop/Project demonstration zone with mobile installation mockups and video islands, an interaction zone with consoles and simulation tables; concluding with a consultation zone with standing tables and contact terminals. Areas are arranged as standalone islands and modules, focusing on model presentation and interaction.

anchor_objects
Standalone full-scale turbo set models (static or sectioned) as visitor anchors for clear demonstration; functional cutaway models for component insight; mobile operation and simulation consoles for interaction; installation mockups and tool carts as demonstration objects; consultation islands with terminals for contact. Function: Exhibition focus, education, interaction, and customer engagement; Mobility: most anchor objects are designed as transportable/movable modules.
