**narrative_assets**

Headline: Electrifying Synthesis.

Core Statements: Pioneer in Germany's use of electrosynthesis as a central technology; accelerates chemical process development through high-throughput screening plus statistics and AI; application cases range from metal recycling to bio-based products; collaborations and publicly funded R&D projects underline relevance.

Measurable Metrics & Signals: Founded in 2018, active national and European R&D projects, and industry collaborations.

**interaction_flow**

Visitors start at an information point and choose between guided demonstrations and self-directed stations. The general path leads from a live demonstration of the screening system to analytical demonstrations, then a data/AI station with case studies. Final discussion areas facilitate in-depth technical and commercial talks with team members.

**zones_layout**

Free-standing arrangement in clear islands: central demonstration island with the semi-automated screening system, adjacent analytics island with equipment representations, a data and AI island with dashboards and models, and project showcases for recycling and bio-based products. Complemented by information kiosk and seating/meeting pods as free-standing encounter spaces.

**anchor_objects**

Typical anchors are the semi-automated screening system (representing process hardware), modular pot cell demonstrators, free-standing props or replicas of GC/HPLC/NMR, interactive touch kiosks for data visualization, sample and display shelves, and mobile process flow models. Purpose: Demonstration, interaction, sample presentation, and knowledge transfer.

Mobility: Many anchors are modular and mobile to allow rearrangements and live demos.
