About Us: Ice Rink. PlayFountain. Passion. Teamwork. You.

Have you seen a playful water fountain in Regensburg this summer, where kids were joyfully jumping around? That was our "PlayFountain."

Ice-World is the global leader in mobile ice rinks. Every year, millions worldwide enjoy our ice rinks, and more recently, our innovative PlayFountain. We love bringing smiles to people's faces.
