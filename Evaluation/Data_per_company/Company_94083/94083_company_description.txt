About Us: As consulting engineers for fire protection, we oversee the entire planning and construction process, from the initial concepts to the final approval of building services. Our planning services ensure structural fire safety for all types of building projects. By involving our company early in the design and planning phase, we facilitate economical and comprehensive fire protection solutions.

Our partners, with extensive experience as architects and engineers, specialize in fire protection planning, particularly for special structures like schools, retail buildings, nursing homes, industrial buildings, and offices. Constructive collaboration with clients, planners, authorities, and contractors is a given for us. With offices distributed across Bavaria and other regions like Saxony, Brandenburg, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, and Schleswig-Holstein, we are always "on-site."

We offer full support from the start of planning to the final inspection, and upon request, we can also provide additional services such as smoke and evacuation simulations, fire load calculations, and engineering methods in fire protection.
