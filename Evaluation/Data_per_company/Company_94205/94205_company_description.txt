About Us: The "Technology Transfer Center: Digital Intelligence" at the TH NÃ¼rnberg facilitates the low-threshold transfer of digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to regional SMEs. In collaboration with academia, industry, and local government, AI topics are implemented and established across different companies and levels in both industry and crafts. Alongside the expansion of applied research, the center raises awareness about AI among medium-sized businesses and offers joint training programs and events for SMEs, their employees, and the community.
