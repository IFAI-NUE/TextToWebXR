**Interaction Flow**

Visitors start at an introduction station providing a company overview and tour options (guided vs. self-exploration). They then proceed through key areas: high-frequency solutions, high-voltage/fiber optics, and engineering demos. Interactive points offer prototype benches and lab stations with media, concluding with a career and contact island. The flow is modular, allowing repeated visits to stations.

**Zones Layout**

Includes introductory pods, a large product gallery, interactive demo labs, prototype workbenches, and career pods. Meeting islands are available for discussions. Space distribution: Product gallery 40%, demo labs 25%, prototype workbenches 15%, career pod 10%, intro/lounge islands 10%.

**Anchor Objects**

Comprising tall product pedestals with exhibits, interactive kiosks, modular demo rigs, hands-on prototype workbenches, freestanding display cases, and mobile presentation carts. They serve as orientation points, technical presentation areas, interaction spots, and recruitment spaces with a mix of fixed and mobile units for flexibility.
