About Us: We are a consortium of ten public broadcasting organizations dedicated to special technical tasks beyond the daily operations of our members. Our work takes place at broadcasting stations, with manufacturers, in the field, at our office in Nuremberg, or remotely. Our topics are extremely diverse, covering almost all areas of broadcasting and media technology.

We investigate complex disruptions, offer advice on current issues like 5G, IT security, cloud production, and energy-efficient IT systems, assist with setting up new studio environments, and optimize existing systems and infrastructure. In summary, we ensure that the broadcasting organizations affiliated with us can operate securely and reliably.

Equipped with modern measurement technology, software, and specialized vehicles, our team primarily engages in metrology, project management, and information security. Our extensive range of tasks also includes EMC investigations, drone flights, antenna inspections, and the development of bespoke software and hardware.

As part of the larger network of public broadcasters, we have maintained a familial atmosphere where every employee is valued and can thrive.
