**Interaction Flow**

Visitors start at a central information pillar with a brief overview, then choose from freestanding stations: product islands (components), assembly demos, and data stations. Each station offers a brief explanation, example parts, and optional interactive media or demonstrations. A standalone career/contact point provides HR information and contacts.

**Zones Layout**

Freestanding arrangement with a central anchor for the main product, surrounding product islands for component categories, a demo zone with assembly and process models, and a data and visualization island with monitor columns. There is a separate career/information area with kiosks and a small lounge area with seating for informal meetings. Space distribution is based on product presence, demo intensity, and communication needs.

**Anchor Objects**

Types: Pedestals with component samples, standalone assembly or test stations (mini rigs), interactive touch kiosks/monitor columns, rotatable display cases, and VR stations. Function: Presentation, demonstration of assembly processes, data insight, and visitor interaction. Mobility: Many objects on rolling bases or as easily movable islands, allowing for flexible adjustments.
