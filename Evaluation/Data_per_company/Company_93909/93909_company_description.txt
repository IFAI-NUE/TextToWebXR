About Us: What is Supply-Chain as a Service?

Our clients are looking for new suppliers and their professional integration to improve the cost-effectiveness and quality of the supply chain. We delve into our clients' products and processes, propose improvements, develop suppliers into supply chain partners, and integrate them using our software into the client's ERP system.

Our focus is on the machinery and plant engineering sectors, as well as the chemical industry. Since 2022, we have been working in a network of freelance supply chain managers on challenging projects where we not only advise but also implement.

We:
- Redesign supply chains by improving processes
- Use web crawlers to find potential suppliers
- Score them using AI
- Model and optimize internal and external (supply chain) processes
- Integrate new suppliers into improvement processes
- Transform clients in procurement, finance, and project management with open-source and proprietary software

Our software plays a critical role in solution and process improvement by fostering interaction with the client and their systems. The details can be found on our website.

How do we proceed?
- We analyze the procurement market and identify potential suppliers
- A project model is agreed upon with the client (Draft Project Design)
- Sourcing explores market potential, creating a list of potential candidates (Long-List)
- The Request-for-quotation (RFQ) phase focuses on price/performance and process awareness (Collaboration Phase)
- Integration into the client’s processes and systems marks the project’s operational phase (Final Project and Process Design)

We are looking for highly interested student assistants, initially in marketing, but also for project work with clients. We look forward to strengthening our team and seek talent for long-term growth.
