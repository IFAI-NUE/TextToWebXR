About Us: It all began in 1999 with three founders who started the company shortly after completing their studies. The name is short for "advanced management solutions," which perfectly describes what we continue to offer our clients.

Our team now includes over 90 people in Germany, Austria, and India, working together and with our clients in various settings. To collaborate efficiently and exchange knowledge, whether in client meetings, remote work, or across different locations, we use modern communication tools like Confluence and MS Teams. Despite our enthusiasm for digital solutions, we value personal interactions as well. Whether it's a chat by the coffee machine, happy hour, or a team meeting - a friendly and family-like atmosphere is important to us.

Our Beliefs:
- Mutual Support: We believe that our culture of boundless collegiality is not only a significant competitive advantage but also a reason why we love coming to work every day.
- Diversity: Our experience shows that working with people of different backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives helps us all excel in what we do.
- Communication: Personal and direct interaction with each other and with our business partners and clients is crucial to us. An open-door policy in leadership's office is not a coincidence.
- Social Responsibility: We see ourselves as part of society and want to give back. Our personal commitment supports children with a rare skin condition. Throughout the year, we organize events to raise funds for research and treatment. Join us in this effort!
