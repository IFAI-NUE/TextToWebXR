interaction_flow

Visitors choose a mode (Quick Overview, Product Deep Dive, Career Insight) and move to freestanding stations with products, interactive demonstrators, and video stations. Each station includes explanatory texts and media in German/English; staff or a virtual guide offers detailed application examples as needed. Contact with sales or recruiting is facilitated through freestanding info terminals.

zones_layout

Zones are arranged as freestanding clusters: Reception/Information Island, Product Exhibition Clusters with individual pedestals, Interactive Demo Islands for live demos, Career and People & Culture areas with open meeting spaces, and an Awards and References Display Island. Space distribution is thematically tiered from intro through product details to career/networking; specific square footage not provided.

anchor_objects

Freestanding pedestals with exhibits (nano drives, sensor prototypes) serve as main anchors and are primarily stationary, some with removable covers for demonstration. Interactive media pillars/touch columns provide detailed information and are mobile or modular. Demo benches with experimental setups allow controlled demonstrations; holographic or video-based displays present application cases. Award and recognition plinths are freestanding reference objects and mobile.
