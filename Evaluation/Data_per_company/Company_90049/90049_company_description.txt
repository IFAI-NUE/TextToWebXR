Our work hours are flexible because life is flexible. We focus on balanced workloads and collaboratively manage seasonal peaks. While we’re not a zero-overtime zone, we handle it constructively. Overtime is accurately tracked, and you decide how to use it: time off, exam preparation, or compensation.

Our Events: Legendary.

We create many opportunities to socialize and celebrate together outside of work. We often combine enjoyment with purpose: our after-work events frequently include social activities, such as supporting local charities. Our running group trains weekly, and we’re looking forward to our next race. Event highlights include our summer party, the annual RISE festival, and our end-of-year celebration.
