About Us: Many software development projects fail to launch or end immediately after development because they are not transitioned into productive, long-term operation. Our institute supports faculties and institutions with the planning, development, and operation of software projects.

Consultation on:
- Applying for software projects regarding future development efforts
- Requirements for production software
- State-of-the-art software technology stacks
- Design
- Service and financial aspects
- Software maintenance and operation

A selection of our projects and collaborations:
- University Job Exchange
- Study & Work International
- GO MATCH
- Practical Days
- University Transfer Forum

The institute is affiliated with the Faculty of Informatics and is excited to offer (computer science) students a creative environment for IT projects, bachelor's/master's theses, doctoral projects, or employment.
