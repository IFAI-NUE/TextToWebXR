About Us: We are a family-run, medium-sized company with 50 employees based in Hof. Our approach combines tradition with modernity: A traditional commitment to quality informs our work ethic, while modern methods drive the realization of your construction projects. 

Our motivated team continually undergoes training. Internal and external courses, such as foreman training, new equipment introductions, or safety seminars, ensure we stay up-to-date. 

We also offer apprenticeships: Every year, trainees start their road construction training with us.
