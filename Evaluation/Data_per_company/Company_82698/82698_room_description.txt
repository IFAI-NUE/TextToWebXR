**Interaction Flow**  
Modes: Self-guided exploration, guided demo, and consultation. Pathway: Orientation at a reception kiosk, followed by demo stations with live test setups and interactive software stations, concluding with discussions in a consultation or offering area and finalizing contact for future projects. Additional Mode: In-depth technical sessions or workshops by appointment.

**Zones Layout**  
Free-standing orientation/reception island for introduction and information materials (small portion). Demo islands with multiple testing stands and measurement tech exhibits form the core area allowing parallel presentations. Hands-on area with adapter pedestals and workbench stations for practical tests, and a separate software/visualization area with touch kiosks. Consultation and meeting niches as free-standing pods for project discussions.

**Anchor Objects**  
Free-standing test stands/demo machines as central anchors for demonstrations and measurements (mainly mobile or on wheels for flexibility). Adapter and component pedestals for presenting mechanical test adapters and interfaces (moveable). Interactive touch kiosks and monitor pedestals for operating test applications and visualization (mobile to semi-fixed). Seating and consulting pods for discussions and mobile VR/AR stations for simulations.
