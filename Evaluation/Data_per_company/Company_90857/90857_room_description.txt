**Interaction Flow**

Visitors begin at a central information station, choose between guided tours or self-directed demonstrations, and explore thematic presentation zones (control, tension management, inspection). Interactive stations provide deeper technical insights and multimedia examples; a career station highlights employer benefits and current openings. The final area summarizes contact and service pathways.

**Zones Layout**

Freestanding zones include a central brand and info station, multiple product demonstration islands (control, tension, inspection), service and support island with offerings, career and training area, and a prototype/CAD model zone. Demonstration islands dominate the space with career and service areas occupying smaller, distinct sections.

**Anchor Objects**

Key freestanding anchor objects: full-scale machine models and modular display setups (function: technical showcase; mobility: generally movable/modular), interactive terminal kiosks and large freestanding displays (function: information and videos; mobility: partially mobile), ergonomic workplace mockup (function: practical example of workplace design; mobility: freestanding, modular), product sample stands, and information desks.

**Circulation and Accessibility**

Specific guidance on minimum aisle widths, entry points, or detailed accessibility measures is not provided. Contextual hints suggest a general sensitivity towards ergonomic and accessible design due to an emphasis on health measures; however, exact parameters are lacking.

**Ambience**
