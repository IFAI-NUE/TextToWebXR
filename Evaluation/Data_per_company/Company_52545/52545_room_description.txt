**Interaction Flow**
Visitors begin at a standalone info kiosk with a compact company overview and navigation to topic areas. Followed by thematic stations on sensors, power electronics, and manufacturing with interactive demonstrators and video documentaries. Deepening at hands-on benches for software/AI demos and a contact point for project inquiries and recruiting. Concluding with the option to download further materials digitally or schedule an expert appointment.

**Zones Layout**
Central information hub with orientation and navigation, surrounded by thematic demo zones (sensors, power electronics, production). Complementary areas with hands-on software/AI tables, presentation zone for videos and case studies, as well as quiet meeting islands and a recruiting/contact stand. All areas are freestanding units, clearly grouped by theme.

**Anchor Objects**
Freestanding info kiosk for orientation and registration (mobile). Sensor demonstration pods (e.g., optical/photoacoustic sensor) for live demos; typically transportable on pedestals or mobile. Test or power electronics rigs as dominant anchors for power topics, large and generally less mobile. Presentation islands with touch kiosks and prototype pedestals for assemblies and PCBs; easily movable. Hands-on worktables for interactive software and firmware demonstrations; mobile or modular design.

**Circulation Accessibility**
Minimum aisle width, entrances, and specific accessibility measures: Not specified.

**Ambience**
Lighting and sound design, music or scent concept: Not specified.
