Products and Services

As a development partner for the automotive industry and a specialist in mass forming and machining processes—both for steel and aluminum—we excel in diesel/gasoline injection, transmissions, drivetrains, chassis, engines, and e-mobility.

Diesel/Gasoline Injection
The diesel engine is one of the most efficient power machines and promises growing market shares. We provide critical components like injectors and rails for highly stressed parts of common rail systems, as well as components for classic injection systems.

Transmission
Manual and automatic transmissions need robust, molded parts. We produce all types of transmission shafts weighing 2 to 25 kg, along with other components like parking pawl wheels and flanges.

Drivetrain
We define the drivetrain from the transmission output to the wheel hub, producing essential components requiring specialized knowledge.

Chassis
We provide lightweight, high-strength components like aluminum steering knuckles and reduced-weight hubs for chassis.

Engine
To meet increased demands for performance and efficiency, engines now feature not only classic forged parts like connecting rods but also additional formed components.
