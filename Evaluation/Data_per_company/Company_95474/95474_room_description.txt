Visitors begin at an information hub with a brief company overview and choose between industry, dental/medical, or manufacturing expertise paths. Subsequently, freestanding exhibits with interactive demonstrations and video stations are presented; live demos and discussion pods are available for technical deep dives. Conclusion: Contact station for project inquiries, OEM collaborations, or career/internship information.

zones_layout  
Freestanding introduction station and company plinth (about 10%), cluster with industrial drives and spindles (about 30%), cluster for dental and medical solutions (about 20%), manufacturing and components area with exhibits and process videos (about 20%), automation and robotics demo zone (about 15%), small lounge/career island for conversations and recruiting info (about 5%). All areas are distinct and clearly defined exhibit groups.

anchor_objects  
Types: Illuminated brand totems for orientation, podiums with high-speed drives and dental micromotors as tactile exhibits, mobile demo rigs with robotics and conveying technology, freestanding vitrines for precision parts, interactive kiosks with CAD visualizations and videos. Functions: Orientation, product demonstration, hands-on experience, technical briefing. Mobility: Totems and mobile demo rigs on rollers; podiums and vitrines preferably transportable but securely fixed.

circulation_accessibility  
Minimum aisle width: recommended at least 1.2–1.5 m for barrier-free access paths and to navigate mobile demo rigs. Entrances: Several standalone access points to exhibit clusters; clear, step-free access to all demo stations. Accessibility: Height-adjustable demo stations, ample maneuvering space for wheelchairs, and audiovisual alternatives (text/audio) for exhibit information.

ambience  
Lighting: Focused, cool white illumination on exhibits with warmer accents in brand areas; spotlights for detail views of components. Audio/Music: Subtle, technical background music with occasional explanatory voiceovers at demos, reduced noise except for live demonstrations, where machine-like soundscapes are present. Scent: Neutral, clean air; in dental/medical areas, a hygienic, fresh perception; in manufacturing demos, a slight metallic-technical nuance.
