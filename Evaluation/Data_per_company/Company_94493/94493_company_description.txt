About Us: We are Regelkraft, a young company connecting renewable energy to the public medium-voltage grid for the past four years. We serve as the link between grid operators and power generation facilities.

Our core product is the "kraftkiste" control cabinet, which contains the necessary hardware for communication and grid protection. Along with our associated services and software, we offer our clients a comprehensive package that is unique across Germany!
