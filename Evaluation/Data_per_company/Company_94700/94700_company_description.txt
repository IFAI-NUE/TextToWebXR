About Us: The Green Landscaping Group operates in gardening, landscaping, and infrastructure projects. Through our subsidiaries, we offer the most comprehensive range of services on the market, aiming to make various outdoor spaces more sustainable and secure.

For both experienced professionals and newcomers, we provide the ideal platform to demonstrate their skills nationally and internationally, offering unique development opportunities within our organizations.

The Green Landscaping Group is a home for entrepreneurs. Our service areas include landscaping, construction, ground maintenance, and snow and ice removal. We operate multinationally with the entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses by acquiring successful companies with these qualities: skilled craftsmanship, professional management, strong values, and a proven track record of high profitability. 

Entrepreneurship is a central theme in the Green Landscaping family. After acquisition, businesses continue to operate as before but gain the advantages of being part of a larger group, including access to a network of peers in the same field and more opportunities for professional development. They become part of an environment with the resources of a larger company. As the group grows and evolves, clients, employees, and owners all benefit. The group takes a long-term perspective, providing homes for the companies that join.
