About Us: As a global specialist in metal forming and a longtime partner of the automotive industry, we develop and produce components for e-mobility, welded and riveted assemblies, functional assemblies, as well as stamped and formed parts. We support our projects from the initial concept to serial production, ultimately integrating them into vehicles from renowned automotive brands. Since our founding in 1967, we have remained a family-owned and self-funded business. Under the leadership of our managing partner, the group has grown steadily. We now employ a total of 750 people across our four locations.
