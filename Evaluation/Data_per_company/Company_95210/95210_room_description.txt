interaction_flow

Modes: Guided tour for decision-makers, self-service demo for technical users, and deep-dive sessions for pilot partners. General Path: Brief introduction at an information kiosk, followed by interactive 3D model stations for portfolio exploration, subsequent simulation tables for prioritization, and final contact/meeting modules for discussion and pilot agreements.

zones_layout

Freestanding zones: Reception/intro point for orientation, clusters with interactive 3D model islands, workstations for simulations and prioritizations, exhibition area for pilot cases and partner information, and modular meeting pods. Space distribution: Demo and model areas take the largest share, followed by hands-on simulations and smaller partner/meeting areas.

anchor_objects

Large freestanding 3D model stations as focal points and interaction spaces, interactive kiosks/tablets for UI demos, high demo tables for simulations, freestanding info columns with partner case cards, and modular meeting pods for discussions; Function: Presentation, interaction, exchange; Mobility: Mix of fixed model stations and mobile kiosks/pods.
