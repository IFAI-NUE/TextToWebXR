About Us: We are a medium-sized engineering company based in Lower Bavaria. Since our establishment in 1993, we've grown steadily and now employ over 360 highly motivated individuals. Our machines and services facilitate the transition to electromobility, hydrogen, and fuel cell technologies.

In line with our motto "For your success," we develop flexible and scalable custom machines for processing, assembly, and testing, which we enhance with external technologies as needed by our clients. Our solutions allow for the production and testing of items like rotors and inverters for e-drives, shock absorbers, solenoid valves, electronic vehicle keys, high-pressure sensors, and electric oil and water pumps. With the rise of electromobility, hydrogen as an energy carrier is also becoming increasingly important. We focus on building long-term relationships with our clients.

We take action where others give up. We see opportunities where others see challenges. We shape the future where others merely participate.

To do this, we need motivated, creative, and smart colleagues. Whether you're a student or an experienced professional, together we can achieve great things! We foster an open company culture, a relaxed work environment, and flat hierarchies. We emphasize teamwork, solidarity, communication, and ongoing development and training.
