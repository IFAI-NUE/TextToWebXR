About Us: Applied Technical Solutions

We're moving forward with extensive experience and expertise in the development and production of testing systems, tackling the challenges of the digital age.

We provide both partially and fully automated testing systems for development and production environments, from consulting to development, manufacturing, and qualification of your testing system, including support.

We offer tailored solutions based on your needs, whether itâ€™s designing the system, conducting feasibility studies, programming testing applications, or providing an experienced project manager. Alternatively, we can deliver a complete solution, possibly in collaboration with our partners.

Our team has significant experience in project work, especially in non-destructive testing methods. This includes contactless measurement techniques like pneumatic and optical methods, as well as tactile measurement methods for electronic component testing. We create mechanical, pneumatic, or vacuum-based test adapters for functional testing systems and guide you through the entire CE conformity assessment process.
