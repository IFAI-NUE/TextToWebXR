About Us: MULTIVAC is a globally leading manufacturer of packaging solutions, whether for food, consumer goods, or medical and pharmaceutical products. But what does that really mean? As a consumer shopping or a patient visiting a doctor or clinic, you encounter products that have been processed, packaged, labeled, inspected, cartoned, or palletized using MULTIVAC equipment. Our machines package and preserve what is valuable for a sustainable future, emphasizing efficient use of packaging materials and other resources, as well as the recyclability of packaging materials.

In 1961, our founder laid the foundations for MULTIVACâ€™s impressive success story. Today, around 7,200 employees at over 80 locations worldwide continue this success. To remain successful in the future, we need energetic, creative, and bold newcomers like you.
