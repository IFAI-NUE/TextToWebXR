About Us: We are a successful regional agricultural trading company specializing in crop production, particularly in plant protection, seeds, and fertilizers. Our operations are managed from our main office. We also have an additional branch. Our customers receive direct deliveries and are served through an extensive network of distribution points within a 100 km radius "just in time."

Founded in 1983, we have grown into a trading company with nearly 10,000 loyal customers. Our motto has guided us for over 40 years: "Advice that succeeds."

As an independent trading company in the agricultural sector, we have focused early on our core competencies in crop production. Our extensive services are further enhanced by two specialty stores, offering a wide range of premium products not only for farmers but also for foresters, craftsmen, and private customers. We also provide a professional workshop for small machinery and motors, along with a comprehensive spare parts service on-site. Our expert advisors are happy to reach out to you.
