**Interaction Flow**

Visitors begin at an info station with an overview and select visit modes (tech demo, project cases, careers). They proceed through sequential demonstration modules showcasing measurement technology, vehicles, drones, and interactive dashboards. Concludes with a consultation/recruitment station for questions or applications. Alternative paths offer deep dives into software/data workflows or field deployment simulations.

**Zone Layout**

Orientation hub and reception area (Approx. 10%), clusters with interactive tech stations and measurement device tables (Approx. 35%), area with large exhibits like vehicle and antenna models (Approx. 25%), demo and visualization islands (Approx. 20%), and a consulting/recruitment area with seating (Approx. 10%). All zones are standalone, clearly grouped by function.

**Anchor Objects**

Large specialized vehicle as a walk-in exhibit for demos and showcasing equipment, mostly stationary. Measurement racks and mobile cases as hands-on demo stations, typically mobile. Drone display or platform with flight recordings, usually securely set. Interactive dashboard kiosks and terminals for data visualization, mobile or easily repositioned. Antenna models and EMC test setups as independent demonstration objects.
