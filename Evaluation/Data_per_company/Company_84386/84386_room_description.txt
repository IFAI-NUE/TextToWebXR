### Interaction Flow

Visitors start at a central orientation point and then select thematic zones (Supply, Renewables, Broadband, Mobility, Careers) for brief introductory modules. In-depth stations offer interactive GIS demos, model evaluations, and video explanations; contact or application options are available at the end. The path is linear with optional branches to deep-dive modules.

### Zones Layout

Thematic islands are arranged as freestanding zones: central reception/orientation island, energy supply island, renewables island, digital infrastructure island, mobility/heating solutions island, and career/community island with lounge elements. The layout allows a mix of short stops and longer deep-dive areas, with each island individually accessible.

### Anchor Objects

**Types:** Interactive info kiosks with touchscreens (Function: Intro info, mobile), large touch tables or globe GIS (Function: Spatial data exploration, less portable), scaled models of plants (Wind/Solar, Function: Visual aid, usually mobile on a stand), fiber cross-section and EV charging station prototype demonstrators (Function: Technical understanding, mobile or fixed), seating and conference pods (Function: Consultation, mobile). Many elements are transportable or modular, while some larger demos may be stationary.
