**Narrative Assets**

- Headline: Over 65 years of stirring technology—made in Germany for the energy transition.
- Key Message 1: Pioneer in electric mixers with continuous product development since 1957.
- Key Message 2: Comprehensive contribution to sustainability by making residual materials usable.
- Key Message 3: In-house manufacturing and practical engineering expertise as quality indicators; measurable indicators: founding year 1957, approximately 150 employees, company-owned solar installation as a sustainability signal.

**Interaction Flow**

- Starts with a free-standing reception kiosk for orientation, followed by a central exhibition axis with product plinths and demonstration areas.
- Visitors can choose between brief overview demos at media displays or in-depth technical stations with CFD/FEM visualization.
- Concludes at a consultation and contact podium, with optional appointment scheduling for plant visits or project discussions.

**Zones Layout**

- Central exhibit area with large product plinths as the focus; adjacent interactive demo zone with media displays and VR/simulation stations.
- A compact development and R&D corner with prototype stands and a service/spare part island for documentation and assembly help.
- Finishing with a small lounge and consultation island with seating areas and conversation pods; space allocation: primarily product display, moderate interaction, minor consultation/R&D.

**Anchor Objects**

- Large, free-standing machine plinths featuring full-scale mixers and section models serve as central anchors and demonstration objects; usually fixed in place.
- Interactive media displays and VR kiosks act as mobile technical anchors for simulations and are movable.
- Consultation and seating pods on wheels offer flexible meeting points; smaller spare part showcases and assembly devices are transportable.

**Circulation Accessibility**

- Open entry zone with clear pathways to anchor objects; recommended minimum aisle width of 1.5 meters for barrier-free encounters and wheelchair access.
- Zone entries should be threshold-free or ramp-free platforms; seating and consultation areas at various heights for diverse needs.
- Information at each exhibit should be tactile and digitally accessible.

**Ambience**

- Energy-efficient, daylight-like LED lighting for neutral illumination, complemented by warm accent lighting on exhibits.
- Subtle soundscape with deep mechanical sounds and light natural tones linking technology and regional origins.
- Scent concept: very subtle, natural notes (e.g., fresh, earthy nuances) to enhance the atmosphere; all systems optimized for energy efficiency in line with company values.
