**interaction_flow**

Visitors start at a freestanding reception and orientation station, choose a path (Products, Technology, Careers) at interactive kiosks, and follow a sequence of freestanding product islands, tech demonstrations, and VR/AR stations. Mobile consulting stations and a career counter conclude the experience, with opportunities for discussions with HR or in-depth technical talks.

**Modes:** Self-guided exploration, guided tours, and career advice in clearly separated, freestanding areas.

**zones_layout**

Entrance area with reception and orientation points, large product zone with multiple freestanding islands for core competencies (transmission, drivetrain, chassis, engine/e-mobility), a tech lab zone with demonstration platforms and VR stations, a career and HR zone with consulting pods, and a lounge and networking area with seating islands.

**Space Allocation:** Product-centered main area, flanked by technology and career sections; exact square footage not provided.

**anchor_objects**

Typical anchor objects include heavy component pedestals (e.g., transmission shafts), mock-up presses, or machinery models as demonstrators, interactive touch kiosks, VR/AR booths, and modular consultation pods.

**Function:** Display, Demonstrate, Inform, Consult.

**Mobility:** Kiosks and consultation pods are modular and movable; heavy pedestals and machinery models are generally stationary to semi-mobile.
