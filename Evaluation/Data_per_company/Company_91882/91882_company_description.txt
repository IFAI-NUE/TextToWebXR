About Us: With over 70 years of experience in the seed business, we are focused on three core activities to best serve our growers:

1. R&D, including hybrid breeding for maize and sunflower, along with developing diversified crop offerings.
2. Seed Production, as a leading hybrid seed producer in Europe.
3. Marketing & Customer Support, across continental Europe, Africa, Asia, and America.

These pillars drive our purpose and shape our mission. We aim to partner with farmers to help them feed a growing global population by better equipping them to face climatic and agronomic challenges. We develop high-performance seed varieties, source top seed-applied technologies, and aid in the development of digital tools to support sustainable agriculture.

Our mission is to provide an innovative and sustainable seed portfolio for cereal and cattle growers. We develop and produce high-performing corn and sunflower varieties and offer a diversified crop portfolio, seed-applied solutions, and digital services that contribute to sustainable agriculture.
