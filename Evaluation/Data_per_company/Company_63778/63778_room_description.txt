**value_proposition_map**

Exhibition stations divide offerings into four free-standing pillars: 1) Industrial trucks (Value: Efficient goods movement; Target: Logistics centers, retail; Proof: Global use) — approx. 35%. 2) Logistics systems and facility integration (Value: Process optimization; Target: Large warehouse operators) — approx. 30%. 3) Services & After-Sales (Value: Availability, lifecycle support; Target: Fleet operators) — approx. 20%. 4) Automation & Software solutions (Value: Efficiency increase, automation; Target: Industry 4.0 customers) — approx. 15%.

**culture_profile**

Cultural values are conveyed through free-standing value stations: Openness to new ideas, taking responsibility, efficiency, and mutual commitment. Tempo: Pragmatic and goal-oriented; Collaboration style: Cross-functional, team-oriented project stations with clear transitions. Work mode: Hybrid settings, supported by free-standing info pods on remote work and flexible hours with visible benefits.

**portfolio_focus**

Displays include free-standing artifacts and demonstrators: Full-scale vehicle models, modular system models, interactive simulation terminals, and video cubes with case studies. Handling: Mobile exhibits for safe demonstration rides and touchless simulations; Safety: Clearly marked distances and free-standing safety markings around moving exhibits.

**narrative_assets**

Headline in illuminated letters: "Making what moves." Core messages on info pillars: Provides integrated solutions; Traditional family company with global reach; Focus on sustainability and resource efficiency. Key metrics/signals are shown on monitor stations: Millions of goods moved daily, international market leader.

**interaction_flow**

Visitors follow a path between free-standing station islands: Welcome pylon → Product islands (vehicles) → System and automation demos → Service and lifecycle station → Career and HR pod. Modes: Self-guided exploration, guided demo sessions at simulation terminals, and short workshop slots at interactive tables. Each station is stand-alone and allows modular entry.

**zones_layout**

Free-standing zone layout: Large product islands with vehicle exhibits dominate the center (~50%), flanked by automation and system islands (~20%), service/after-sales islands (~15%), a career/recruiting pod (~10%), and a small lounge island (~5%) for conversations and breaks. All areas are designed as independent, movable units.

**anchor_objects**

Key free-standing anchor objects: Full-scale industrial trucks (functional for demos, partially mobile), scalable system models on pedestals, interactive touch kiosks, and VR simulation stations. Functions: Demonstration, interaction, orientation; Mobility: Most anchor objects are mobile or modularly movable.

**circulation_accessibility**

Flow: Clear, intersection-free paths between free-standing islands with a minimum width of 1.5 m for accessible passage. Entrances: Several free-standing reception platforms and archways for varied route selection. Accessibility: Free-standing ramps, tactile ground indicators to main stations, and audio support at kiosks.

**ambience**

Lighting: Directed spotlights on free-standing exhibits and warm ambient beams over lounge islands; Audio: Subtle industrial ambience with explanatory voiceovers at stations and zone-specific background music. Scent: Neutral, clean air fragrance via free-standing diffusers; Acoustics: Free-standing partitions and absorbers for clarity.
