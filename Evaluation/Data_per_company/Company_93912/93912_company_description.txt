About Us: The company 3X Banktechnik GmbH, based in Heiningen (Baden-Württemberg), is a service provider for financial institutions across Germany. We manage the entire process, from the planning of a construction project to its completion.

Space-Forming Measures: Our project managers, planners, and site managers handle the necessary tasks throughout all phases of your construction project. They implement your decisions in terms of space, design, time, and cost, as discussed with you. This includes architecture and design, tendering all services, and coordinating craftsmen — with our site manager, of course, being on site.
