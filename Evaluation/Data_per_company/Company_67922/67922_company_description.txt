About Us: Lindner is differentâ€”in the best way.

The Lindner Group isn't just a construction company focused on interior finishing, insulation technology, and building envelopes; we're a diverse family business that also ventures into real estate, gastronomy, and even organic farming.

Through the Lindner Foundations, we aim to give back to society, and for over 20 years, we've operated our own multigenerational homes. We offer countless opportunities for career growth and development, as our leaders often emerge from our own ranks.

For us, "Building with New Solutions" means not only developing, producing, and executing innovative ideas for construction projects worldwide but also advancing digitization and sustainable transformation towards a circular economy. Ideally as a team, ideally with you. We look forward to your application!
