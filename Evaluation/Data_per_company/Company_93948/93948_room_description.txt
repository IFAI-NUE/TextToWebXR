**Interaction Flow**

Visitors start at a central information and orientation station, choosing between product, technology, or career paths and move to thematic demonstration islands. At the island systems, there are multimodal interactions: live demos, video timelines, touch information points, and hands-on sample platforms. Specific testing and discussion areas are designated for students and applicants; concluding information and contact options close the visit.

**Zones Layout**

Freestanding central orientation unit/reception (small signage island). Product islands with machinery and process demonstrations (largest area share). Software and automation island with interactive terminals. Inspection and quality assurance island with samples and measuring equipment. Career and research island for internships, theses, and recruiting. Relaxation and conversation area with seating for concluding discussions.

**Anchor Objects**

Large-format machine models or mockups as eye-catchers and demonstration platforms (usually stationary). Modular conveyor prototypes for live demos (mobile or semi-mobile). Interactive touch kiosks and tabletop terminals for software demos (mobile or podium mounted). Product pedestals with packaging samples and patterns (mobile). VR/AR stations for immersive process insights (mobile). Service/tool carts for on-site demonstrations (mobile on wheels).
