About Us: Since 1987, our "FinTech" has been all about the stock market. We provide everything from stock market information and recommendations to accessories and the development of rule-based strategies. We also offer investment options, equipping investors with the tools they need to succeed in the financial markets.

Our headquarters span more than 2000 square meters in our own publishing house, which includes a daily open "House of the Stock Market," featuring the Pop Art "Bull 8 Gallery" and Germany's only stock market museum.

Our clients appreciate our champion stocks and trust our transparent, rule-based, and innovative investment strategies. Our "Guide for Your Wealth" has gained a cult status.

We are completely independent and advocate for a better stock market culture in Germany. Long-term investment in the worldâ€™s top companies naturally leads to prosperity, while inflation devalues paper money. Our "Mission Pro Stock Market" is supported by thousands of investors who have invested over 500 million euros in "Made in Rosenheim" investment alternatives.

If you want to make an impact in a unique stock market environment, the boerse.de Group AG could be the perfect fit for your career!
