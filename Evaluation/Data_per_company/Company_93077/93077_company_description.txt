About Us: Who We Are - Digital, Agile, and Personal

With over 9 million customers, we are the third-largest bank in Germany. Our core products include checking accounts, home financing, savings, consumer loans, and securities. In the Business Banking segment, we provide loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. In Wholesale Banking, we offer banking services to large international companies. With more than 6,000 colleagues, we are based in Frankfurt am Main (headquarters) and have offices in Berlin, Hanover, and Nuremberg.

"You don't look like bankers at all!" We hear this often, perhaps because things are a bit more lively and relaxed here. And simpler. We often experiment with new things instead of analyzing for years. To make this work, we have short decision-making paths, flat hierarchies, and value good collaboration.

Can a Job Change Everything?

Working with us is not just a job. It's a chance to make an impact. How? As a global bank, we move a lot of money and decide what happens with it: whom we lend to, what we finance, and which products and services we develop. This way, we touch the lives of millions and strive to have a positive influence on society and our planet. But that's no reason to become aloof. On the contrary, with our start-up mentality, we remain human, approachable, and personal – a bank that's anything but typical.

How Can You Get Started? Just Be Yourself!

Study and work with us? Or jump into a career right after graduation? Both are possible.
We're looking for everything but just numbers, data, and facts. We're looking for people! With diverse backgrounds, experiences, and lifestyles. Team players with small egos and big agile mindsets. We want to meet you, whether you're studying computer science, economics, natural sciences, or humanities.

Want to tackle exciting projects, implement new ideas, and develop yourself further? Then jump into practice. But be prepared – "typical bank" isn't what you'll find here. You'll join a global company but experience a start-up culture with quick agreements and direct exchange on topics that make banking simpler and more innovative.

Ideas Matter, Not Who Has Them

Our passion is all about diversity, initiative, teamwork, and innovation. We have strong roots in the Netherlands. In Frankfurt, Berlin, Nuremberg, and Hanover, we set things in motion – even if we're not always on-site together. People with diverse backgrounds and lifestyles work together through our hybrid work model. This makes us vibrant and successful. We live this diversity with virtual and personal meetings and digital exchange formats.

More Agile, Faster, Better: We Work Agile

It’s all about our customers' satisfaction. If something is important to them, it certainly is to us! That's why we work agile and respond faster and more flexibly. But what does that mean?

Most of us work in small units that deliver quick results, planning in short project cycles called sprints. We regularly adjust and replace traditional project plans with rigid guidelines. This has made us the first agile bank in Germany.

Our agile work leads to great results, satisfying not just our customers, but us too! Learn more: [Link]
